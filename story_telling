if people cannot visualize what you are telling them, then you are not story telling correctly 

most well known book for story telling in this field is called Good Charts. 
do not pack your visualizations should not be packed with info
sometimes giving the audiance a single example is necessary to explain things correctly.
Visulaization and story telling go hand in hand with this industry 
Plots Graphs and CHarts.
plot - points marked on a coordinate system, continues axes.
graph - diagram of a math function 
chart - graphical info 

Types of visual Communication - Declariative, Conceptual(these two most important) Data driven, Exploratory(like pairplots).

Dashboard story telling stands alone without a representation... (hard)
keep dashboards as simple as possible 

Dashboards can be live or uploaded manually 
Executive Dashbnoards are rough

you can collect API info from  big companies
Cole Knafic - has a good way of teaching us good visualizations
