overview---understanding what makes a good story? ----- creating a story --- advanced prep: seven questions ---- refine and present -- tableau ----- trello demo --- project.




if people cannot visualize what you are telling them, then you are not story telling correctly 

most well known book for story telling in this field is called Good Charts. 
do not pack your visualizations should not be packed with info
sometimes giving the audiance a single example is necessary to explain things correctly.
Visulaization and story telling go hand in hand with this industry 
Plots Graphs and CHarts.
plot - points marked on a coordinate system, continues axes.
graph - diagram of a math function 
chart - graphical info 

Types of visual Communication - Declariative, Conceptual(these two most important) Data driven, Exploratory(like pairplots).

Dashboard story telling stands alone without a representation... (hard)
keep dashboards as simple as possible 

Dashboards can be live or uploaded manually 
Executive Dashbnoards are rough

you can collect API info from  big companies
Cole Knafic - has a good way of teaching us good visualizations

what makes a good story 

Effectiveness
highlights the truth and does not deceive 
tells the intended story 

Berinato recommends 7 steps to systematically critique charts. Doing so helps us understand what makes a good chart, the first step to being able to create a good chart. 
And being able to create a good chart is the first step to being able to create a good story.

note - first few things you see and first ideas that come to minds
answer- do things i noted match the charts main idea or apparent intent
answer- is there anything missleading or missing 
note - likes or dislikes, wish i saw
answer - what r 3 things u would change 
sketch - sketch on paper your own version

       3 Step Process to Analyzing Your Data (General case)
Define your goal, why this matters, your target variable, initial hypotheses (write these down)

Get to know your data: obtain a 10,000 ft view of your data before diving in (write down what you learn/discover)

Answer your initial hypotheses questions with visuals and statistics (write down takeaways as you go)

Step 1: Define your goal. What's the impact? Who benefits? Why does this matter?

Take lots of written or typed notes here.

What, exactly, are you seeking to understand?

Define your target variable. Does one exist in your dataset?

Define your initial hypotheses: literally write them down

Are the stakeholders hoping to confirm or deny something already? That's a good start.
What initial hunches do you have? How could you confirm or deny them?

Are there industry based hunches you can confirm or deny?

If you have data from your industry, how does your dataset compare?

Based on the columns you have, do you see anything you know you need to look at?

Define your Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

How do you know when you're done?

How do you know when you've got something to deliver?

If something seems interesting but out of scope, add it to your backlog and get back to the heart of the matter






Step 2: Get to know your data at a high level

Dump out all your legos and take inventory of what you have

Take lots of written or typed notes as you move through these steps)

Hunt down a data dictionary that explains what each column of your data is or represents.
This may mean talking to people
This may mean having coffee w/ someone from accounting to pick their brain

Determine if there's any columns needing cleaning or a change in data type

Hunt for any nulls or missing data. Write down how you handle them. There's no one right answer.

What's the distribution of your target variable? What about your most interesting variables?



Step 3: Answer your initial hypotheses with visuals and statistics

Always write down your takeaways as you learn or reveal them

Use visuals, descriptive stats, and inferential stats to answer your hypotheses

Start with one hypothesis at a time.

Visualize and get stats on the population

Start making subgroups to compare subgroups to the population and subgroups to subgroups

Focus on getting the biggest bang for your buck rather than counting toenails on an ant.
