### Hi there :)


--- I am currently working on codeup fundamentals...
- I am currently learning the basics of terminal and python..
-I am looking for help on improving my skills for the future.
--fun fact: I have worked on the external field and infustructure side of electrical and data grids the majority of my life... this will be my first time diving into the internal side of electrical and mechanical learning systems.
